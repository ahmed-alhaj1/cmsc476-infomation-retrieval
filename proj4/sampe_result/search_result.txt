     **COMPUTER MOTION LAUNCHES AESOP 2000**
    
    
    
     **WORLDS FIRST FDA CLEARED SURGICAL ROBOT CAPABLE**
    
    
    
     **OF UNDERSTANDING VOICE COMMANDS IS NOW AVAILABLE**
    
    
    
     _San Francisco, CA, October 7, 1996 --_ At the American College of Surgeons
    82nd Clinical Congress, Computer Motion, the worlds leading supplier of
    medical robots, announced the release of its next generation surgical robot --
    AESOP 2000 with Voice Control. AESOP 2000 features the most intuitive
    interface available, the ability to understand a surgeons voice commands. This
    allows the surgeon to use spoken English to precisely maneuver and position a
    laparoscope (a specially designed optical tube which, when connected to a
    medical video camera and light source, is passed into the body to allow the
    surgeon to view the operation on a video monitor).  
    
    
    
     AESOP 2000 (pronounced "eesop") is the second generation of the companys
    flagship product, and was cleared by the FDA in May 1996. A clinical advisory
    team comprised of leading endoscopic surgeons has worked closely with the
    company throughout the development of the surgical robots voice control
    interface. Clinical validations have been successfully completed at over 15
    institutions across the nation.  
    
    
    
     "Surgeons have been asking for an easy way to control their field of vision
    during surgery. Our research has confirmed that voice control is the ideal
    interface. We are delighted to offer this advanced solution today," said Gene
    Wang, CEO & President of Computer Motion. "We plan to apply our voice control
    technology across a broad range of surgical devices to create an industry
    standard surgeon-to-machine interface for the operating room."  
    
    
    
     AESOP (an acronym for Automated Endoscopic System for Optimal Positioning)
    was first introduced in October 1994. Over 15,000 minimally invasive surgeries
    have been successfully assisted by AESOP in over 150 hospitals and surgery
    centers around the world.  
    
    
    
     "I love it [AESOP 2000]!" said Dr. Carlos Gracia, a leading endoscopic
    surgeon at San Ramon Regional Medical Center, San Ramon, CA. "Its quiet, it
    does what you tell it to do, it doesnt complain, it doesnt fatigue and has a
    precision that I cant even duplicate when Im holding the camera for someone
    else."  
    
    
    
     Computer Motions core development team, led by Chief Technical Officer and
    Founder, Dr. Yulun Wang, has worked together for over ten years and holds
    several key patents in robotics for medical applications. Computer Motion is
    currently developing robotic and computer enhanced devices for new surgical
    applications which leverage the core technologies underlying the AESOP family
    of products.  
    
    
    
     Founded in 1989, Computer Motion is the world leader in medical robotics. The
    companys mission is to enhance surgeons capabilities and improve outcomes
    while reducing costs in the operating room using computers and robotics.
    Computer Motion is privately held and is based in Goleta, CA. The companys Web
    site is http://www.ComputerMotion.com.

     |  |  **Online entertainment still trails TV**  
    By  Alex Lash  
    July 14, 1996, 10 a.m. PT
    
    
    
     Most computer users do not consider the online world a replacement for other
    sources of entertainment, according to a survey from Intelliquest's Worldwide
    Internet/Online Tracking Service in which just 17 percent of respondents
    described cyberspace "always" or "usually" better than than television.
    
    
    
     Conducted in April and May, the study covers the home and business use of
    people 16 and older in the U.S. Some of the conclusions are as follows:
    
    
    
     Fifty-four percent of the 16-and-over population use a computer, including at
    home, work, or school. Of computer users, 32 percent ventured online in the
    three months prior to being interviewed, which projects to 35 million user of
    the Internet or online services.
    
    
    
     Nearly half of those who go online, about 15 million, said they are connected
    no more than 2 hours per week. Of the remaining 20 million users, about 8
    million access from home and are online more than 5 hours per week, an
    important statistic for those looking to exploit the Internet as a home
    entertainment medium.
    
    
    
     The survey drew no comparisons between the Internet and printed
    entertainment, although 61 percent described themselves as  "avid" readers of
    books.
    
    
    
     The survey also confirmed some of the conventional wisdom concerning the Net:
    64 percent of users are male, 46 percent are college-educated, and 60 percent
    have household incomes over $50,000.
    
    
    
     Putting the numbers against a larger backdrop, the survey found that 35
    percent of all full-time U.S. students 16 and over are online, compared with
    only 4 percent of unemployed or retired people. Only 14 percent of all small-
    business employees use online services.
    
    
    
     Webmasters might be interested to know that 26 percent of users "always" use
    a search engine and 13 percent "always" use bookmarks (although 44 percent
    "never" use them, most likely the same people who refuse to use a map or read
    instruction manuals).
    
    
    
     Other findings included: 75 percent used email in the month before their
    interview; 69 percent accessed the Web; 52 percent went online to obtain
    general news; 49 percent sought out information about "specific products and
    services;" 32 percent read an online magazine; 31 percent downloaded shareware
    or freeware; and 7 percent attempted an online banking transaction, the same
    number that accessed adult entertainment.

         ABOLITION 2000
         
         A Global Network to Eliminate Nuclear Weapons
         
         The Abolition 2000 Network is a network of over 300 organisations and
         growing on every continent working for the abolition of nuclear weapons.
         It grew from many seeds - the World Court Project, the International
         Coalition for Non-Proliferation, the Global Alliance against Nuclear Arms=
         ,
         the Abolition Caucus, etc. All of these movements are like streams that l=
         ed
         into the river that is the Abolition 2000 network. It is not a membership
         body but is open to all organisations endorsing the ABOLITION STATEMENT,
         drafted at the NPT Conference in New York in 1995. Its over-arching
         premise is the vision of entering the 21st century with a plan in place f=
         or
         the elimination of nuclear weapons.
         
         What is the Network?
         300 organisations have organised themselves into what was termed a
         "tight" (rather than the usual loose) network which aims to provide group=
         s
         concerned with nuclear issues a forum for the exchange of information
         and the development of joint initiatives. The "tightness" of the network
         (like the tautness of a web) is defined by how close the members of the
         network work together and how good the lines of communication are.
         
         The Network plans to have an office in California, USA, staffed by a
         facilitator. The Global Network Office will be overseen by a Management
         Group. The substantive work of the network is done by International
         Working Groups on issues relating to the abolition of nuclear weapons.
         
         How did it come about?
         In 1995 at the Conference to Review and Extend the Non-Proliferation
         Treaty in New York a group of 40 to 50 activists, representing NGOs from
         all around the world met each day to coordinate their work and called
         themselves "The Abolition Caucus". This group drafted a consensus
         document which was known as the "Abolition Statement". In less than two
         weeks the first 200 organisations had signed the statement and this
         number is still growing. Added to this, the International Coalition for
         Non-Proliferation organised a meeting during the NPT Conference on a
         Draft Nuclear Weapons Convention, called "Beyond the NPT". The
         demand for a Convention became the prime focus of the lobbying work of
         the Abolition Caucus and also of the Abolition Statement. They called on
         the delegates to
         
         initiate immediately and conclude by the year
         2000 negotiations on a nuclear weapons abolition
         convention that requires the phased elimination
         of all nuclear weapons within a timebound
         framework, with provisions for effective
         verification and enforcement.
         
         The Abolition Caucus requested the NPT parties to adopt this goal in the
         final report of the Conference. The opposition to the indefinite,
         unconditional  extension of the NPT was clearly expressed in the original
         statement, which has since been updated to remove references to the
         Conference and other dates.
         
         Development of the Network
         A core group went on to organise a further meeting in The Hague to
         coincide with the oral hearings at the International Court of Justice in
         November 1995 of the advisory opinion on the use and threat of use of
         nuclear weapons (World Court Project). The 60 participants at this
         meeting agreed by consensus to found a network and defined its
         structure. The title "Abolition 2000 - A Global Network to Eliminate
         Nuclear Weapons" was chosen.
         
         The idea of a "tight network", consisting of regions, working groups and =
         a
         distribution/communications centre (later titled the "Global Network
         Office") was born. Most importantly it was decided that there should be
         no central committee to take decisions on behalf of the network, and that
         initially no common strategy would be decided, except to take action
         under the only agreed common position: the Abolition Statement, which
         everybody had signed. The group that had organised the meeting in The
         Hague was given the task of setting up the office and finding the funding
         for a staff person for it. A second meeting in Edinburgh in March 1996
         gave this group the title "Interim Management Group", whose function is
         solely to oversee the functioning of the Global Network Office. The
         members of the Interim Management Group are:  Lysiane Alizard
         (France), Colin Archer (Switzerland), Janet Bloomfield (UK), Reiner Braun
         (Germany) Jackie Cabasso (USA), Michael Christ (USA), Xanthe Hall =20
         (Germany), Pamela Meidell (USA), Alice Slater (USA), and Alyn Ware, =20
         (Aotearoa/NZ).  It was agreed that this group should be more regionally =20
         balanced than it presently is, and it is hoped that new members will be =20
         found before the next full meeting of the Network in the Pacific Region i=
         n =20
         1997.
         
         The Regions
         The Regions are at present North America, Central and South America,
         Europe, the Pacific, Asia, Africa and the Middle East. The Network has
         some organisations in all of these regions, but the strongest are the Pac=
         ific,
         Europe and North America. Asia has much activity, but little participatio=
         n
         in the meetings at present. Some regions are establishing regional
         networks to look for common strategies. The USA, Canada, Germany and
         Norway have formally established abolition networks.

         The Working Groups
         The Working Groups deal with substantive issues arising out of the
         Abolition Statement. They concentrate on furthering the 11 points
         included in the statement and recommend further strategies to the
         Network. The members of each working group are fluid, but the convenor
         remains the same. Some groups meet regularly and others communicate
         by e-mail, fax, telephone and post. Anyone interested can participate at
         any one time by contacting the convenor.

         The time is right to demand a Nuclear Weapons Convention (NWC). As in
         the Abolition Statement, negotiations should start now because it will be=
          a
         long process to complete them, and NGOs should be involved in this.
         Working for a NWC is the logical next step of the World Court Project, as
         it is for the International Network of Engineers and Scientists and the
         Pugwash, who have set up a Study Group on the NWC. At the group's
         meeting in New York in March 1996, an outline of the elements of a model
         treaty was discussed with various participants taking on the drafting of
         specific language. An executive summary of the treaty is now complete
         and has been forwarded to the Canberra Commission (a Commission of
         experts convened by the Australian Government to discuss concrete
         measures to achieve the abolition of nuclear weapons). Plans are being
         made to organise a World Conference to Abolish Nuclear Weapons in
         1998.
         
         Overcoming Nuclear Threats: convened by Rob Green (WCP UK)

         E-mail: robwcpuk@gn.apc.org
         The group is assessing and will report on the implications of the
         International Court of Justice's advisory opinion(s). It will propose act=
         ions
         for the nuclear weapons states to comply with the ruling. It aims to
         coordinate the work to challenge the doctrine of deterrence. The
         deterrence doctrine and the abolition of nuclear weapons are
         incompatible. There is a brochure on the implications of possible Court
         rulings, which will be updated after the ruling itself. Also there is a
         brochure on "Deterring War Responsibly". Both are available from Rob
         Green.
         
         Nuclear Test Ban and Beyond: convened by Jackie Cabasso (WSLF)
          1440 Broadway, Suite 500, Oakland, CA 94612, Tel: +1-510-839 5877, Fax: =

         mail: wslf@igc.apc.org
         The work of this group refers to the points on testing in the Abolition
         Statement: working for a truly comprehensive test ban that prevents
         development of nuclear weapons and for the closure of the test sites. The
         CTBT negotiations are now underway in Geneva. The Test Ban will most
         likely not be comprehensive because the nuclear weapons states have
         developed the technical capability to replace testing. Computer simulated
         tests are far from messing around on a laptop - the facilities are as big=
          or
         bigger than football stadiums. Above Ground Explosions take place that
         are not technically termed nuclear explosions although explosions take
         place using nuclear material. There are also plans for "laser fusion"
         facilities at Lawrence Livermore Laboratory in California, USA and in
         Bordeaux, France (Megajoule). Technical knowledge and understanding of
         what subcritical, hydrodynamic or hydronuclear tests are, or what laser o=
         r
         intertial confinement fusion is will be an important task of this group.
         These are the methods of the future that will enable the nuclear weapons
         states to continue collecting data and experimenting with the
         modernisation, miniaturisation and design of nuclear weapons. The group
         is campaigning to get language introduced into the preamble of the CTBT
         (language available from Jackie Cabasso) that will specifically refer to =
         the
         prevention of the development of nuclear weapons as the intention of the
         treaty. The concept of "The Test Ban and Beyond" is to favour an early
         conclusion of the CTBT, while recognising that this will not fulfil our
         objectives and therefore planning for beyond this. Action in 1996 and 199=
         7,
         following completion of the CTBT, centre around the subcritical tests
         planned in the United States.
         
         Fissile Materials (no convenor as yet)
         Much work is going on in this area by organisations in the Network
         although a working group has not yet formally been convened. The
         Conference on Disarmament in Geneva plans to negotiate a fissile material
         "Cut-off" after completion of the CTBT. Discussions at present are around
         the issues of banning fissile material completely - i.e. destroying stock=
         piles
         - and the production of fissile materials in the civilian sector. If the
         stockpiles remain, the present status quo will be perpetuated, as with th=
         e
         NPT and most likely with the CTBT, that the declared nuclear weapons
         states retain their capability, while forbidding it for all others. This =
         is not
         disarmament. Disallowing fissile material production only in the military
         and not in the civilian sector repeats the mistake of the NPT by ignoring
         that nuclear energy produces bomb material that can be diverted, legally
         or illegally, for military purposes. The question of fissile material
         production is important because it cuts off the source of material - "pul=
         ling
         the plug on the bomb".
         
         Chernobyl: convened by "For Mother Earth"
          Lange Steenstraat 16/D, B-9000 Gent, Tel + Fax: +32-9-233 8439, E-mail:
         fme@int.knooppunt.be
         This group was originally set up to coordinate the activities for the 10t=
         h
         anniversary of the Catastrophe at Chernobyl. It has developed a petition,
         addressed to Boutros Ghali asking for the IAEA to stop promoting nuclear
         power and for the UN to set up an International Alternative Energy
         Agency, which will be circulated until November 30th 1996. This area is a=
         n
         initial breeding ground for cooperative work between disarmament and
         environmental groups. The pro-nuclear lobby tried to claim that the
         medical consequences of the Chernobyl accident were very low (no more
         than 30 deaths). Calculations from German physicians put the figure at
         around 25,000 deaths so far, an increase in thyroid cancer 100 times high=
         er
         in the worst hit areas, and diabetes figures have doubled. The main point
         is not the figures but the suffering, physical and psychological.
         
         A Non-Nuclear Security Model for Europe: convened by Solange Fernex
         (WILPF and Greens, France)
          F-68480 Biederthal, France, Tel: +33-89-407183, Fax: 407804
         This group is looking at NATO and WEU and the unacceptability of these
         alliances in the future for solving security problems. The WEU is accepte=
         d
         as the European leg of NATO. An opportunity to open the discussion on
         common security policy in Europe is emerging preceding Maastricht II.
         NGOs should try to intervene in this discussion. The group proposes that
         the OSCE is the correct organ to work on security in Europe through
         solving conflicts non-violently and on a political level. The OSCE is muc=
         h
         bigger than WEU or NATO, with 54 member states, including states from
         Eastern Europe, neutral states and all NATO members. Security is not a
         military problem, but often to do with ethnic, religious or economic
         problems rather than a threat of outside invasion. The OSCE is currently
         under Swiss Presidency. It is launching a discussion on a model for
         security in the 21st century and is inviting input. The group suggests
         encouraging non-nuclear weapons states to participate in this discussion.
         If the WEU is accepted as Europe's security force, then the currently
         proposed security arrangement - a European nuclear deterrent shared by
         France, UK, Germany, Belgium, Holland, Spain, Greece, Turkey and
         others - will become a reality.
         
         Lobbying, Dialogue and Campaigning:
         convened by Xanthe Hall (IPPNW Germany)
         Koertestrasse 10, D-10967 Berlin, Tel: +49-30-693 0244, Fax: 693 8166, E-=
         Mail:
         ippnw@oln.comlink.apc.org
         This working group arises out of work that IPPNW has being undertaking
         in the last year or more as their main area of work. Physicians and other
         professionals have the ability to influence decision-makers in their area=
         s of
         competence. During lobbying work on the CTBT and NPT it has become
         clear that many organisations are involved in lobbying and this work
         often crosses over. This working group would focus on methodology; it
         would help set up international delegations and avoid duplication of
         efforts; it could discuss best approaches to different negotiating forums.
         IPPNW has also been working with Oxford Research Group on
         Dialoguing with Decision-Makers, such as nuclear scientists, arms traders=
         ,
         military leaders. IPPNW  has met with NATO to discuss a nuclear weapon
         free zone in Eastern Europe. Already had some success in bringing
         military leaders from Britain and China together to discuss security and
         abolition. The lobbying and dialoguing needs corresponding campaigning
         to show the breadth of support behind it and to involve the grassroots
         with this work in postcard, letter-writing and fax actions. Working with
         political parties, locally and nationally, as well as local authorities i=
         s very
         important. The idea of nuclear free zones is useful in this context.
         
         Media, Communication and Outreach:
         convened by Janet Bloomfield (CND)
          162 Holloway Rd, London N7 8DQ, Tel: +44-171-700 2393, Fax: 7002357, E-m=
         ail:
         cnd@gn.apc.org
         This group will focus on outreach - getting other groups and networks
         involved, especially with the use of internal media from national and
         international groups. It will discuss how best to use the newspapers, TV
         and Radio and develop a register of sympathetic journalists around the
         world to feed information to. A cinema advertisement for the World Court
         Project is available for adaptation, with a changed message at the end to
         promote Abolition 2000. Copies are available on video. Another media
         tool is "Court TV", which recorded the entire oral proceedings at the ICJ=
          in
         November, and made them into a series of programmes for cable TV in the
         US. Some of the commentators of these programmes were from the
         Network.

         signatories are invited to yearly meetings of the Network.
         
         *	Join the E-Mail list server "abolition-caucus" by sending a message to
         majordomo@igc.apc.org. The text should be in the body of the message
         and not the title and should say "subscribe abolition-caucus". Anyone can
         join this and will receive from and can send messages to any of the other
         participators on the subject of Campaigning for abolition.
         
         *	Take part in one or more of the substantive working groups. Contact the
         convenor of your preferred issue and ask them what the method of
         communicating with the group is or to send you information on the issue.
         
         *	Take part in a regional or national network, or in setting one up. The =
         more
         developed these networks become, the easier it will be to make consensus
         decisions on points of strategy in the future, should we wish to do so.
         
         Networking is a skill which relates to non-violence. Each group or
         individual takes on work according to their interest and ability.
         Networking looks for common ground in preference to conflict. Its basis i=
         s
         cooperation and complementation rather than competition. The challenge
         for this network is to abolish nuclear weapons.

     **Lancaster, Pennsylvania**
    
    
    
     * * *
    
    
     ##
    
    
    
     **Jack D. Lausch, Sr. Transfer Station**
    
    
    
     One of the Authority's oldest facilities is the Jack D. Lausch, Sr. Transfer
    Station, located just beyond the city limits of Lancaster at 1291 Harrisburg
    Pike.
    
    
    
     Built in 1968, expanded in 1978 and 1984, and completely renovated in 1990,
    the transfer station serves as a central drop-off point for trash haulers who
    collect refuse within the 946 square miles which make up Lancaster County.
    
    
    
     ![](trnstn.jpg)  
      
      
      
    **_At the transfer station, waste is compacted into Authority transfer
    trailers and trucked to either the Frey Farm Landfill or the Resource Recovery
    Facility._**  
      
      
      
      
    
    
    
     Every day, more than 200 commercial haulers and residents pass over the
    transfer station's electronic scales which record, via computer, the amount of
    waste contained in each vehicle. Trash is deposited in one of four bays, where
    the waste is compacted into Authority transfer trailers. Each day, these
    transfer trailers haul approximately 800 tons of waste to either the resource
    recovery facility, the Frey Farm Landfill or a recycling center.
    
    
    
     In addition to being centrally located within the county, the transfer
    station also provides Authority compliance officers the opportunity to inspect
    each load of waste to make sure the materials are acceptable and to dispatch
    that waste to the appropriate disposal site. Combustible materials go to the
    resource recovery facility while noncombustible items are directed to the Frey
    Farm Landfill.
    
    
    
     The Authority sends recyclables to various recycling markets, while the on-
    site Household Hazardous Waste Facility collects hazardous wastes generated in
    area homes.
    
    
    
     The Authority also requires separate delivery of materials which may be
    better disposed through methods other than resource recovery or landfilling.
    For example, all tires and white goods (household appliances) must be
    delivered separately from other refuse. Tires are sent to a recycling facility
    and white goods, after chlorofluoro- carbon gas removal, are taken to
    recycling centers.
    
    
    
     The transfer station includes a maintenance facility, where mechanics perform
    most repair work and state inspections on Authority vehicles and equipment.
    The maintenance facility also houses a tire changing room, welding shop, wash
    bay, paint bay and offices.
    
    
    
     For the convenience of the employees who work at the transfer station, the
    complex includes a lunchroom and locker rooms.  
      
    
    
    
     For more information or if you have questions, please contact the Authority
    office in Lancaster County at 717-397-9968.

     This is it, folks. Endeavor lands tomorrow, and we're going home either
    tomorrow or Wednesday. What a long, strange trip it's been ...
    
    
    
     Y'know, we've been writing these things for a week and a half now, and I
    wonder if anyone has been reading them. I'm going to post our E-Mail addresses
    at the end of this, so that if you get the urge -- to say hi, to ask further
    questions, or just to tell us that you read these things -- you can.
    
    
    
     Yesterday was Aaron's air-ground link with Endeavor, and we'll let him speak
    up later. First, yesterday's report talked a lot about the outside of JSC,
    which is interesting, but kind of superfluous. The really incredible stuff is
    what's IN the buildings.
    
    
    
     You already know about the Clean Rooms, Mission Control, and EOL. The only
    other place that we've got personal experience with is Building Eight. Half of
    building eight is the on-site medical facility. The other half, the half we've
    used has video and photo labs, and a computer set up to print photos from
    laser disk.
    
    
    
     I've got to diverge from my divergence for a bit to tell you about the
    photos. An average shuttle mission comes home with three to five thousand
    frames of photographic film, from cameras high enough quality that they can
    take detailed Earth pictures from orbit. These pictures are all developed,
    numbered, cataloged according to latitude \ longitude, main visible features,
    etc. This information is stored in a database at JSC called
    sseop.jsc.nasa.gov, which is public access. NASA also publishes laser disks
    which contain several tens of thousands of shuttle photos apiece, which makes
    it slightly easier to find, let's say, the photos from STS-42, roll 97, frame
    143.
    
    
    
     That's the only other building that we know from personal experience.
    However, we've been told about a lot of incredible stuff, which hopefully
    we'll get to see once the shuttle has landed. There's a building which is set
    up to run simulations in Mission Control. It has the capabilities to feed data
    into Mission Control that exactly replicates a shuttle mission, and they can
    go through any number of "anomalies," to see how well the ground crew is
    prepared for them. Unless you have participated in a simulation, you're not
    allowed through Mission Control unescorted during a mission.
    
    
    
     Astronaut training goes on here, and I assume they've also got the standard
    battery of equipment that you've seen in The Right Stuff. However, I'm told
    that they have a full array of VR equipment. The American government is just
    about the biggest user of VR in the world, for just such applications like
    this. The equipment they use today probably saves them thousands of dollars
    per astronaut in materials used for training.
    
    
    
     A slight divergence, and then we'll go to Aaron. If anyone out there in
    Netland is interested in working on a shuttle mission, this is for you. STS
    68, the second SRL mission, is flying in August. By then, we would like to
    have a network of people across the country (or even across the world, if
    possible) on-line to JSC during the mission. If any of these people knew of
    anything interesting going on in their area (flooding, fires, anything major
    that could be seen from space and might make a difference to the radar) they'd
    write in to us with a report of what they knew, where they were, any and all
    information that they thought pertinent. Our information here is limited by
    what gets put on the Net or in the newspapers. If it's something like a
    volcano eruption or an earthquake, we're not likely to get any information
    until it's over, and while aftermath is probably interesting, it doesn't give
    us any more information about the way the world works. So, if you're
    interested in helping out a shuttle mission, write to either Aaron or Jon.
    
    
    
     And now, to wrap up the series, here's Aaron with what happened last night.
    
    
    
     STOP THE PRESSES! Before Aaron says a word, we've forgotten to thank the six
    most important people in the entire mission!
    
    
    
     Thank you, Shuttle Commander Sidney Gutierrez.
    
    
    
     Thank you, Mission Specialist Michael Clifford.
    
    
    
     Thank you, Pilot Kevin Chilton.
    
    
    
     Thank you, Mission Specialist Thomas Jones.
    
    
    
     Thank you, Payload Commander Linda Godwin.
    
    
    
     Thank you, Mission Specialist Jay Apt.
    
    
    
     These six are the astronauts who served aboard the Endeavour (we've been
    leaving out the u in Endeavour all week. Oops.) for STS-59, the Space Radar
    Laboratory. It was their incredible dedication and hard work that enabled this
    mission to go so spectacularly smoothly. And we almost forgot to thank them.
    Shame on us. Now back to our regularly scheduled report.
    
    
    
     Here we go. To start out, I was talking to Linda Godwin, the Payload
    Commander. It was kind of neat because I also talked to her once before, last
    summer at JPL. No particular amenities were exchanged; the format of our
    conversations with the crew are a long comment, then several smaller comments
    with space for response. I told her about how I worked two years ago in the
    field on the upper peninsula of Michigan, on one of the sites that they have
    imaged. I told her about what an incredible experience it was, getting away
    from a science class to do something like that, or like working at JSC. The
    feeling is absolutely different. Learning on the job like this is incredible.
    What I'm doing matters, and that makes all the difference in the world. If
    something goes wrong in a high school physics class, nobody cares. Here, when
    someone asks you to find something out and they need it in an hour for the
    shuttle flyby, you don't get a chance to do it over. And you do NOT fail. If
    you did screw up, I don't really think that anyone would care; they plan for
    that, and it happens. But that's not what happens. You do it. You do the best
    job possible. And if it involves learning some radar science, or meteorology,
    or computer science, well, them's the breaks.
    
    
    
     I love it.
    
    
    
     Anyway, once I got done with that, I noted that I had been wondering how
    different the training had been for this mission as opposed to her others, and
    she was nice enough to oblige me by telling me. Pretty much the same thing
    happened when I wondered what differences she noticed in the state of the
    world between yesterday and a week before that. All in all, it was fun and
    informative, and I got a real kick out of talking to the shuttle.
    
    
    
     OK, folks, here's where we get off. It's been fun -- we all learned a little,
    and nobody got hurt. I hope that you've enjoyed reading these things as much
    as we've enjoyed writing them. We encourage correspondence -- that's how you
    learn, and learning's how you grow.
    
    
    
     Signing off,

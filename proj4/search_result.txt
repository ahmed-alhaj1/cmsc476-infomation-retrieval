     ## 1995 ACU Ratings Citizen Test
    
    
    
     ### HOUSE VOTES
    
    
    
     You've seen how the American Conservative Union rates the Members of
    Congress. Now take the test yourself and see how you stack up against Newt
    Gingrich and the House of Representatives.
    
    
    
     1\. **BALANCED BUDGET AMENDMENT**. Barton substitute amendment to propose a
    constitutional amendment to balance the budget by 2002 or two years after
    ratification. The amendment would require a three-fifths majority of the
    entire House and Senate to increase taxes, engage in deficit spending or raise
    the public debt limit; a simple majority could waive the requirement in times
    of war or in the face of a serious military threat.
    
    
    
     Support  
    Oppose
    
    
    
     2\. **LINE-ITEM VETO**. Passage of the bill to allow the president to rescind
    any budget authority or cancel certain targeted tax benefits in a bill within
    ten days after enactment, with Congress having 20 days to pass a bill
    restoring the spending or benefit.

    defense for U.S. territory, replacing it with a provision stipulating that
    combat-readiness, weapons modernization and deployment of a defense against
    short-range ballistic missiles should have a higher priority than deployment
    of missile defenses for U.S. territory.
    
    
    
     Support  
    Oppose

     Support  
    Oppose
    
    
    
     5\. WELFARE OVERHAUL. Adoption of the Rule to provide for House floor

    through a variety of proposals, including a $500-per child tax credit, the

    capital gains tax rate from 28 percent to 19.8 percent, and to offset the
    costs through various proposals.
    
    
    
     Support  
    Oppose
    
    
    
     8\. **FY'96 BUDGET RESOLUTION**. Neumann substitute amendment to balance the
    budget by 2000, rather than 2002, by cutting $612 billion more in outlays than

     _Summary from the 1994 National Christian Home Education Leadership
    Conference Phoenix, Arizona - October 20-23, 1994
    
    
    
     **Please reproduce for home school community only!_**
    
    
    
     **The Impact of Home Education on  
    Learning Disabled Children: A Look at New Research  
    Dr. Steven Duvall**
    
    
    
     Dr. Duvall is a behavioral psychologist, who limits his professional studies
    to objectively measurable behaviors. The methodology he uses is to identify
    what can be measured and then manipulate the environment to see how it changes
    what he can measure. One of the factors in education which can be measured is
    the amount of time and the kind of interactions which take place in school.
    This has been shown to make a very significant difference in the educational
    outcomes of students in traditional classrooms. Dr. Duvall is trying to
    measure what kind of a difference it makes between home and public schools.
    
    
    
     Two of the biggest differences between home and public special education
    classrooms are in the _physical arrangement of the room_ and the _amount of
    academic responses_. Home schools had children and teachers sitting side-by-
    side or face-to-face 43% of the time, while special education classrooms had
    such an arrangement only 6% of the time. This is an obvious educational
    advantage for home schools. Public school classrooms used a divided group
    approach most (67%) of the time, and only placed children with special needs
    in a full group setting 25% of the time. Home schools, by contrast, used the
    divided group approach only a fraction of the time (11%) and were much more
    likely to include the special child in a full group experience (43%). Home
    schools therefore provide special children with more one-on-one attention
    **and** more full participation than public school special education
    classrooms do.
    
    
    
     Dr. Duvall's most important findings centered on the amount of academic
    responding on the part of each child with special needs. As a behavioral
    psychologist, Dr. Duvall is familiar with a large body of research that proves
    that education is function of the amount of time a child spends in
    **educational interactions** , as opposed to the time the child spends merely
    **sitting in class**. In this respect, home schools have an enormous advantage
    over public special education classrooms. Children in public school special
    education classrooms spent 74.9% of their time with **no** academic responses.
    Home-schooled children only spent 40.7% in this mode. (See Figure 1, detailing
    the amount of time in various academic modes.)
    
    
    
     Dr. Duvall's methodology was very objective, involving a research technique
    that has been perfected over the last twenty years. Using a laptop computer,
    he sat in on teaching sessions and took an observation every 20 seconds,
    creating tens of thousands of data points that were then fed into a
    statistical analysis package. His research frequently included a second
    observer, who double-checked Dr. Duvall's readings to ensure that the
    observations were truly objective. At the end of the school year, Dr. Duvall
    measured the children's academic progress. He found a strong correlation
    between increased academic interaction and increased academic results,
    demonstrating that home schooling really works for children with special
    needs.
    
    
    
     Dr. Duvall concluded with suggestions on how home schoolers could be even
    more effective in helping children with reading difficulties. His research,
    which targeted the **method** of instruction, did not differentiate between
    different kinds of **content**. He has a booklet on "Parents as Reading
    Teachers" which can help parents achieve even better results.
